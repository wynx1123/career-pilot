# Frontend Component Style Guide

## Overview

This document defines reusable frontend UI patterns, styling conventions, and component usage guidelines used throughout the project. The goal is to maintain consistency, scalability, accessibility, and a cohesive user experience across the application.

## Purpose

This guide serves as a centralized reference for reusable frontend components and interaction patterns used across the application. It helps maintain consistency in design, accessibility, and developer experience.

# Button Component

File Reference:

```text
frontend/src/components/Button.jsx
```

## Supported Variants

- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `danger`
- `outline`
- `ghost`
- `gradient`

## Supported Sizes

- `sm`
- `default`
- `lg`
- `xl`

## Features

- Loading state support
- Disabled state handling
- Framer Motion animations
- Hover and tap scaling interactions
- Reusable styling through `className`
- Consistent rounded design system

## Example Usage

```jsx
<Button variant="primary" size="default">
  Submit
</Button>
```

## Styling Guidelines

- Use `primary` for major actions
- Use `secondary` for optional actions
- Use `danger` for destructive actions
- Use `ghost` for minimal emphasis actions
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Prefer reusable variants over inline styles

## Animation Patterns

Buttons use subtle motion interactions:

```jsx
whileHover={{ scale: 1.03 }}
whileTap={{ scale: 0.97 }}
```

Transitions are configured using spring animations for smoother interaction feedback.

# General Frontend Guidelines

## Component Reusability

- Reuse shared components whenever possible
- Avoid duplicate UI implementations
- Extend existing components before creating new ones

## Styling Consistency

- Use utility-first styling consistently
- Maintain spacing and typography standards
- Prefer reusable variants over inline styling

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide labels and ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation support

## Animation Principles

- Maintain consistent animation timing across components

## Recommended Practices

- Keep components modular
- Use descriptive prop names
- Maintain consistent file structure
- Keep UI responsive and accessible
